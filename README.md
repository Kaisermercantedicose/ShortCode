||*Standard pronouns*

>### The sequence order of the cases is:
|NOM/ACC|DAT/GEN|ABL/VOC
|-|-|-

If a case couple that is not NOM/ACC appears without previous the cases marked, it is specified through a tone:

**Ascendent- ̆**  for **DAT/GEN**

**Descendant- ̯**  for **ABL/VOC**

If the case is the second of the couple (ACC without NOM, GEN without DAT, and VOC without ABL), that case is marked by ʰ.
>## Variations of the vowel *i* per case:
|NOM|ACC|DAT|GEN|ABL|VOC
|-|-|-|-|-|-
|i|iʰ|ĭ|ĭʰ|i̯|i̯ʰ

Each morpheme that is not a part of the root is represented by a phoneme.

The interrogative pronoun is **x**, and the *NPP* (neutral personal pronoun) is o̞:

**Whom** are you giving it **to?**

ɮɪ̈xo̞

```ɮ      ɪ̈                 x       o̞```

```give   1SG.NOM-3SG.ACC   INTER   NPP```

To you!

ɪ̆!

The copula is **ɸ** :

Whose is it?

ɸexŏ̞ʰ

```ɸ    e         x       ŏ̞ʰ```

```be   3SG.NOM   INTER   NPP.GEN```

It’s mine.

ɸeĭʰ

The negation is made by putting **q** after the vowels:

I’m not giving it, that is his/hers, to you.

**or**

I’m not giving to you what’s his/her.

ɮɨɪ̈q

**Hey, y’all**, what’s yours?

**ʌ̯ʰ** ɸxo̞ʌ̆ʰ

**↓**

2PL.VOC = **y’all!**
